We initially began with conglomerating all of the information about the WheelRight and PV4EV systems, drawing from Ray&#39;s VR tour, website, press releases, and additional research. Furthermore, we were tasked with tying in a light, energetic, and forward-thinking visual design of the ray with its heavy data.After designing the data visualizations, we focused greatly on how to contextualize and frame them so as to guide a viewer logically through the story while providing valuable and impactful statistics and statements.Throughout the design process, we worked iteratively, referencing other info visualizations and receiving feedback from the client in order to create the best possible visualizations."
